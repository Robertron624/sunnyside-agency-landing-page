## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to add texts over images to make them more readable. I also learned how to use flexbox and grid to position elements on the page.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about flexbox and grid. I also want to learn more about other positionings for different elements like the header or footer.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Position Text Over an Image](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_text.asp) - Great resource for positioning text over images.
